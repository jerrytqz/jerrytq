            For presentations, I have always used a slideshow as my means of presenting. However, for the Capstone Project, I chose to do something 
            much more creative by making a website. In doing this, I have also managed to gain a better understanding and appreciation of 
            myself, especially by recognizing all my achievements in my high school career.`;

            profile and stats. I also implemented a Django backend for authentication and access to a database. This project came solely from my 
            imagination and creativity outside of school. While making it, I had to reflect on and revise my code numerous times for best practices 
            and optimization purposes.`;

            as pollution and misjudgement. By writing poems to spread awareness of these issues, I have demonstrated that I am socially aware of the 
            injustices in the world today and that I am taking responsibility by spreading my awareness to others.`;

            the span of an hour while communicating online has been one of the most teamwork dependent tasks I have ever taken on. To finish in 
            time and with quality, we had to ensure that everyone knew what they were doing, that everyone’s perspectives and ideas were heard, 
            and that we were effectively communicating and understanding each other.`;

            for, encouraging me to challenge what I have taken for granted. As a result of finding so many things that I should be happy about, my 
            mood and overall happiness has been greatly boosted. I have ultimately become more personally aware and responsible for my mental health 
            by creating this gratitude journal.`;

            I feel that I conveyed my ideas in a much more clear, concise, and effective manner. Working on this project also required lots of collaboration 
            as I had a partner whose English was not the best, but everything went smoothly nevertheless.`;
